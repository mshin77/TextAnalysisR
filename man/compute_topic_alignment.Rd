\title{Compute Topic Alignment Using Cosine Similarity}
\usage{
compute_topic_alignment(stm_model, embedding_result, stm_vocab, texts)
}
\arguments{
\item{stm_model}{A fitted STM model object.}

\item{embedding_result}{Result from fit_embedding_topics().}

\item{stm_vocab}{Vocabulary from STM conversion.}

\item{texts}{Original texts for computing embedding topic centroids.}
}
\value{
A list containing alignment metrics:
\itemize{
\item alignment_matrix: Cosine similarity matrix between topics
\item best_matches: Best matching embedding topic for each STM topic
\item alignment_scores: Alignment score per topic
\item overall_alignment: Mean alignment across all topics
\item assignment_agreement: Agreement between document assignments
\item correlation: Correlation between assignment vectors
}
}
\description{
Computes alignment between STM and embedding-based topics using cosine similarity
on topic-word distributions and document-topic assignments. This method follows
research best practices for cross-model topic alignment.
