\title{Plot Per-Document Per-Topic Probabilities}
\usage{
topic_probability_plot(gamma_td, top_n = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{gamma_td}{A tidy data frame derived from \code{tidytext::tidy(stm_model, matrix = "gamma")},
where \code{stm_model} is a fitted Structural Topic Model created using \code{stm::stm()}.}

\item{top_n}{The number of topics to display, ordered by their mean prevalence.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing a bar plot of topic prevalence. Topics are ordered by their
mean gamma value (average prevalence across documents).
}
\description{
Given a tidy data frame of per-document per-topic probabilities (gamma),
this function calculates the mean topic prevalence across documents and plots the top topics.
}
\examples{
if (interactive()) {
  # Assume stm_model is a fitted STM model.
  gamma_td <- tidytext::tidy(stm_model, matrix="gamma")
  plot <- topic_probability_plot(gamma_td, top_n = 10)
  print(plot)
}
