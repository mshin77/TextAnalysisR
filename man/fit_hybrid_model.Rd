\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item stm_result: The STM model output (use this for effect estimation)

\item alignment: Alignment metrics between the two models
\item combined_topics: Integrated topic representations
\item metadata: Metadata used in modeling (needed for effect estimation)
}
}
\description{
Fits a hybrid topic model combining STM with embedding-based methods.
This function integrates structural topic modeling (STM) with semantic embeddings
for enhanced topic discovery. The STM component provides statistical rigor and
covariate modeling capabilities, while the embedding component adds semantic coherence.

\strong{Effect Estimation:} Covariate effects on topic prevalence can be estimated using
the STM component via \code{stm::estimateEffect()}. The embedding component provides
semantically meaningful topic representations but does not support direct covariate
modeling. This hybrid approach combines the best of both worlds: statistical inference
from STM and semantic quality from embeddings.
}
\note{
For covariate effect estimation, use \code{stm::estimateEffect()} on the
\code{stm_result$model} component. The metadata must include the covariates
specified in \code{stm_prevalence}.
