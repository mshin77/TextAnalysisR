The rationale for the study was that the hand-held calculator might be a device that could free the educable mentally retarded student from the laborious tasks necessary to master algorithms, so that time could be devoted to algorithm application and concept development. The population sample was comprised of 50 secondary educable mentally retarded students (23 experimental and 27 control) from Wood County, West Virginia. Four intact class units (2 experim",

A multiple time-series design encompassing two pretests, a treatment, and two post-tests was implemented during twelve weeks. The treatment consisted of systematic calculator instruction in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for the experimental group and traditional instruction in the same areas for the control gr",

The variables were further examined in relation to total group, grade level, sex, and separate algorithms with pretests being used as covariates. Motivation was examined prior to the administration of the first and second post-tests. The t test was used to determine significance. The analysis of covariance indicated the followin",
