<p><code>TextAnalysisR</code> provides a supporting workflow tool for
text mining analysis. The web app incorporates <a href="https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda" class="external-link">quanteda</a> (text
preprocessing), <a href="https://github.com/bstewart/stm" class="external-link">stm</a>
(structural topic modeling), <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph" class="external-link">ggraph</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/juliasilge/widyr" class="external-link">widyr</a> (network analysis).
<a href="https://github.com/cran/tidytext" class="external-link">tidytext</a> is implemented
to tidy non-tidy format objects. The R Shiny web app is available at
<code><a href="../reference/TextAnalysisR.app.html">TextAnalysisR::TextAnalysisR.app()</a></code> or <a href="https://textanalysisr.org" class="external-link uri">https://textanalysisr.org</a>. Functions are provided for
completing word-topic probabilities, document-topic probabilities,
estimated effects of covariates on topic prevalence, and network
analysis, similar to tasks available in the web app.</p>
<p><strong>These steps are similar to those demonstrated in the Shiny
web app at <code><a href="../reference/TextAnalysisR.app.html">TextAnalysisR::TextAnalysisR.app()</a></code>.</strong></p>
