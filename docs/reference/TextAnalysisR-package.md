# TextAnalysisR: Text Mining and Natural Language Processing Toolkit

Comprehensive toolkit for text mining and natural language processing
with an interactive 'Shiny' interface. Import documents from multiple
formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT) using 'Marker' for PDF extraction,
preprocess with 'quanteda', and perform linguistic analysis via 'spaCy',
topic modeling ('stm', 'BERTopic'), semantic analysis, sentiment
analysis, and network visualization with 'plotly'. Features
topic-grounded content generation and AI-suggested labeling via local
('Ollama', 'spaCy', transformers) and web-based ('OpenAI', 'Gemini')
APIs, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, multi-language support, and enterprise
security for production deployment.
